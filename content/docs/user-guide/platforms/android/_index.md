**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** projects for Android rely on the Gradle build system to build the final APK that launches and runs O3DE projects. O3DE provides the **Android Project Generation script**, which generates the Gradle build scripts that you need to build your O3DE projects for Android. The Gradle build scripts use CMake to compile the native C++ code, compile and build the Android application (Java), and construct and package the final APK and project assets. 


## Prerequisite software and packages

### Java Development Kit (JDK)
The latest version of the Java Development Kit is needed to both compile the android java source for the project as well as to create a Java Key Storage (JKS) files used by the Android SDK to sign the APK.

### Gradle
[Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) (version 6.7.1 or newer) is the build system designed to build and create Android applications.

### Android SDK
The [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio) contains Android libraries, packages, NDK, and other tools that are needed to build the Android application for an O3DE project. Download the latest version of Android SDK through the Android Studio or the command line tools. 

### CMake
[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/#latest) (version {{< versions/cmake >}} or newer) is a project generator that O3DE uses for all native C++ builds, regardless of the platform. 

### Ninja Build System
The [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) build system is used by CMake to build the underlying native C++ code for an O3DE project.

## Setup Requirements

### Android SDK setup
You can set up and configure the Android SDK by using Android Studio, an IDE commonly used with Gradle to develop and build Android applications. When you launch Android Studio for the first time, follow the steps to download and install at least one SDK platform. You can also set up and configure SDKs from within Android Studio, if it's already set up.

Keep track of the location where you installed the Android SDK, as you will need it later to generate an Android project for O3DE. 

### Prerequisite packages installation

In order to simplify project generation steps, add the other prerequisites (Java, Gradle, CMake, and Ninja) to your PATH environment variable. Otherwise, you must configure the paths to each respective package by using the command line arguments for the Android Project Generation script.

### Android Keystore
The Android build process creates APKs that you must sign before you can deploy them. You can configure a signed APK for your generated project after creating the project through Android Studio, or you can sign the APK during the project generation step. Android uses the JKS format so you can use the `keytool` Java command to sign your APK. 

|Field Name|Keytool Argument|Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Distinguished Name ([DN](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2253)) | `dname` | Descriptive name of an entity to identify the owner of the key. |
| Alias Name | `alias` | The identifier for the key and certificate in the KeyStore file. A KeyStore file may contain multiple keys and certificates.|
| Key Password | `keypass` | The password to protect the individual signing key. |
| Keystore Password | `storepass` | The password to protect the entire KeyStore file. |
| Validity Period | `validity` | The length of time in days that the certificate is valid for, starting from the day the KeyStore was created.|

### Android assets
Before you can generate an O3DE Android project, you must process and prepare the assets for Android. You can do this by using the **O3DE Editor** and the **Asset Processor** (or **Asset Processor Batch**) on your project.

Specifically for Android, you must configure the registry settings value so that the Asset Processor can process Android platform assets. To do this, update the `<engine-root>\Registry\AssetProcessorPlatformConfig.setreg` file.

In the `Amazon/AssetProcessor/Platforms` section of the file, set the `"android"` flag to `"enabled"`. For example:

```
"Amazon": {
    "AssetProcessor": {
        ...
        "Platforms": {
            //"pc": "enabled",
            "android": "enabled"
            //"ios": "enabled",
            //"mac": "enabled",
            //"server": "enabled"
         }
    ...
}
```

Alternatively, you can use `--platforms=android` when launching the Asset Processor Batch. Refer to step 3 in [Generating Android Projects on Windows](/docs/user-guide/platforms/android/generating_android_project_windows/#steps).

After you've processed the assets for Android, you can proceed to generate the Android project.

| `--signconfig-store-file` | (Optional) An Android JKS KeyStore that is used for APK signing when the project needs to be built and deployed to an Android device.

(Refer to the [Android Key Store](#android-key-store) section for more information.) | None | - If not specified, the generated Android project will not include any signing information. You can still build the Android project, but you cannot deploy to any device.<br>- You can add the signing key information after project generation through Android Studio. |

## Android Deployment Script
Find the script to deploy the Android project at `<engine-root>/cmake/Tools/Platform/Android/deploy_android.py`.

The `deploy_android.py` script contains the following arguments:
| Argument&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-h`, `--help` | Shows the help message and exits. |     |     |
| `-b`, `--build-dir` | The build directory of the project to deploy from. |     |     |
| `-c`, `--configuration` | The build configuration of the built binaries to deploy from. |     |     |
| `--device-id-filter` | A comma separated list of connected Android device IDs to filter the deployment to. | All connected Android devices. | Only used when multiple devices are connected and you want to filter which devices will be the target for the deployment. |
| `-t`, `--deployment-type` | The type (`APK`, `ASSETS`, or `BOTH`) to deploy:<br/><br/>**`APK`**<br/>Deploys only the APK without any external assets (refer to the `--include-apk-assets` option in `generate_android_project.py`). Any assets that're already included in the APK will be deployed as well. <br/><br/>**`ASSETS`**<br/>Deploys only the assets for the APK. This option is only valid if you didn't set `--include-apk-assets` during the project generation.<br><br>**`BOTH`**<br> Deploys both the APK and assets, regardless of the `--include-apk-assets` option. | `BOTH` | Deploying the APK and assets separately can optimize different workflows. For example, developers who update only the code should use `APK` to make their deployments more efficient (provided that the assets are deployed at least initially). In another example, technical artists who only update the assets should use `ASSETS` (provided that `--include-apk-assets` was not set during project generation).|
| `--clean` | Cleans the target Android device by uninstalling any pre-existing projects before deploying. |     |     |
