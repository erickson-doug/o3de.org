This section contains tutorials on  PostFX components and PostFX modifiers. The **Atom Gem** provides many post-processing effects (PostFX), such as **Bloom** and **Depth of Field**, and PostFX modifiers, such as **PostFX Layer** and **PostFX Shape Weight Modifier**, to assign PostFX to layers and control their volume, area, and weight.

Atom Gem is enabled in **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** by default; for more information, refer to [Atom Gem](/docs/user-guide/gems/reference/rendering/atom/atom/). For more information on PostFX components, refer to the list of [Atom components](/docs/user-guide/components/reference#atom) and [PostFX Modifier components](/docs/user-guide/components/reference/atom/post-processing-modifiers.md).
