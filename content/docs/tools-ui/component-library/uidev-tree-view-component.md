With the **tree view** component, users can navigate file system directories or a list of hierarchical data in O3DE. Each item, such as a node or a branch, can have sub-items. Items can be expanded to reveal sub-items.

The **tree view** component is often used in the following scenarios:
+ Show system or predefined contents, such as the settings in Inspector or system settings page.
+ Show user created contents, such as in File Directory or Outliner.

Example from O3DE **Asset Browser**:

## Usage guidelines

Follow these guidelines as you design your UI with tree views:

1.  When the tree hierarchy is anticipated to be deep, such as a tree view used in file directories, it is suggested to add a file path to help users know where they are in the path.

## Basic tree view

![component tree view basic](/images/tools-ui/component-tree-view-basic.png)

Create a simple tree view, with support for showing branch lines.

### Example

```cpp
#include <AzQtComponents/Components/Widgets/TreeView.h>
#include <QTreeView>

// Create the tree view.
auto treeView = new QTreeView(parent);

// Set the model on the tree.
treeView->setModel(new MyModel);

// Set a BranchDelegate to support branch lines in your tree view.
treeView->setItemDelegate(new AzQtComponents::BranchDelegate());

// Show the connecting branch lines.
AzQtComponents::TreeView::setBranchLinesEnabled(treeView, true);
```
